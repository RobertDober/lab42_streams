# Lab42::Streams Demo

## Basic Stream Tutorial

Streams are lazy, immutable lists, or for the purists, lazy cons cells (well the tail/cdr is lazy, the head/car is not).

Here are two demonstrations of that concept:

### Infinite Streams

```ruby
    def fibs a=0, b=1
      cons_stream a do
        fibs b, a+b
      end
    end

    fibs.drop(1000).head.assert == 43466557686937456435688527675040625802564660517371780402481729089536555417949051890403879840079255169295922593080322634775209689623239873322471161642996440906533187938298969649928516003704476137795166849228875
```

There are several things to remember here:

* The tail of a stream is *always* provided as block or lambda, the only way in ruby to
implement a normal order parameter.

* The result of the tail (that is when the delay or promise the tail defines is forced or realised)
must be a `Stream`. This has to be automated into your reasoning about `Streams` lest you will
have difficulties to come up with stream based solutions.

* When the promise of the tail is forced the stack frame of the `cons_stream` call is not active
any more, there will be no stack overflow.


### Transformation Chain

One major advantage of streams (and lazy evaluation in general) is that transformations can be composed without any performance penality.

While for example the following code would be terribly inefficent

```ruby
    elements = { 2 => "two", 4 => "four" }
    list = 1..2 # but imagine a very large value of 2
    list.map{ |x| x * 2 }.map{ |x| elements[x] }.map(&:reverse)
```

the following stream based code is not.

```ruby

     translation = { [true,true] => "fizzbuzz", [true, false] => "fizz", [false, true] => "buzz" }
     integers    = Stream.iterate 0, :succ
     fizzbuzz    = integers
        .reject{ |x| (x%100).zero? }
        .map{ |i| [(i%3).zero?,(i%5).zero?,i] }
        .map{ |f,b,i| translation.fetch([f,b],i) }
```

The reason for this is that, up to now, no single computation has been done, but _promises_ for doing so
have been registered. Only when we eventually force values these computations will be executed and then
it will make little difference if we execute one complex computation or five simple ones.


A different way to look at this is in the following application

```ruby
    fizzbuzz
      .drop( 1000 )
      .take( 15 ).assert == ["fizz", 1012, 1013, "fizz", "buzz", 1016, "fizz", 1018, 1019, "fizzbuzz", 1021, 1022, "fizz", 1024, "buzz"]
```


There is absolutely no performance penalty here, when we eventually realize the stream with `take`, and only
then, we will execute the transformations.


And as we operate on **infinite** streams it becomes obvious that the implementation must delay up to the end.

### Memoization

The fourth point to know about `Streams` is that:

* All promises are **memoized**.



Only for that reason the following na√Øve, but elegant implementation of the fibonacci sequence has O(N) runtime
characteristics, and the result can be computed:

```ruby

    fibs1 = cons_stream(0){
      cons_stream(1){
        # Without memoization we would evaluate the fibs call tree twice
        combine_streams fibs1, fibs1.tail, :+
      }
    }

    fibs1.drop(1000).head.assert == 43466557686937456435688527675040625802564660517371780402481729089536555417949051890403879840079255169295922593080322634775209689623239873322471161642996440906533187938298969649928516003704476137795166849228875
```


## Finite Streams

Finite Streams are implemented the same way LISP imlements lists, by providing an _End_Marker_. What is `nil` in LISP
is `empty_stream` in Ruby. As a matter of fact the `empty_stream` method returns a singleton called `Lab42::Stream::Empty` which
is also accessible via `EmptyStream` if you required the lib with `require 'lab42/stream/auto_import'` which is true for the demos.

Here is an example of a finite stream

```ruby
    digits = finite_stream( 0..9 )

    digits.drop(9).head.assert == 9
    digits.drop(10).assert.empty?
    digits.drop(10).assert == EmptyStream
```
